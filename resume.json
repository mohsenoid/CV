He immediately settled in and built our Android app with an astonishing pace. All our developers were in admiration of his speed and output. By the end of 2017 his app had become the backbone to our early demos and Kickstarter backer livestreams, and Android our \"we build things first here\" platform. Mohsen is a great person to work with, fits into any team, can work with anyone, understands very fast what you are trying to achieve and will find fast and lean ways of building what you need, while not forgetting to refactor later and ensure a well polished code base. He is also a great evangelist, presenting at conferences and promoting the company. He built up a team of 3 Android developers, and was a very good team lead too. He is well respected amongst peers, team and management. He is a great asset to have in any team."

In the past year and a half, there was not a single day that he hasn't teach me something. \nI would highly recommend Mohsen as a supervisor, colleague, and friend.\n\n"
