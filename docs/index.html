Mohsen is a great person to work with, fits into any team, can work with anyone, understands very fast what you are trying to achieve and will find fast and lean ways of building what you need, while not forgetting to refactor later and ensure a well polished code base. He is also a great evangelist, presenting at conferences and promoting the company. He built up a team of 3 Android developers, and was a very good team lead too.
